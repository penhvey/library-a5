                    <h3>Treat customers with respect:</h3>
                    <p>Treating customers with respect is the foundational block of long term loyalty since the customer feels that you actually listen and value their opinion.In our increasingly competitive world, customer expectations are continuously growing. Unless you go out of your way to guarantee that your customers feel happy, you might risk losing them. 

                        The math is simple. Unhappy customers stop paying for your services = you lose revenue. Happy customers want to continue buying from you and even tell their friends about it = you boost conversions.</p>

                    <p>Making mistakes is a part of life. We all make them, and we learn from them. The key is to admit your mistakes when you make them, which can be difficult, especially if you're in a position of authority. However, when you recognize your mistakes, you maintain trust and credibility with the people around you. You also show that you are human and willing to own up to your actions. This blog post will discuss the importance of admitting your mistakes and how they can help improve your relationships with others.</p>

                    <h3>Keep your promises:</h3>
                    <p>Do you have an easy time making promises and a hard time keeping them? The definition of a promise “a declaration that one will do or refrain from doing something specified; a legally binding declaration that gives the person to whom it is make the right to expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of a specified act.”[1] If you have difficulty following through on even the smallest or seemingly minor promises to others, it might be time to focus on creating a process that allows you to always keep your promises.</p>
